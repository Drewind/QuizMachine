Hello VeriDocs developers!



It took me a little longer than I want to admit to configure and setup this project.
Somehow did not have a valid MySQL server installation on this machine, so that took some time.
Identity also consumed a portion of my time to configure.


With more time I would have went through and refactored the algorithms I wrote. Some are
in O(n) and a couple others are O(n^2), which I understand is bad. I hope that through this project,
you are able to see my expertise in OOP concepts and general web-development skills.


For the user and account creation, I went with Identity. With Identity, it creates its own
table structures which can be overriden, though overriding and implementing those functionalities
would have taken double the time I had. So in the sake of time, this website uses the default
ASP.NET Identity user settings. With that said, I did configure the lockout settings to lock the
user out after three unsuccessful attempts.


I seperated out the application logic using OOP concepts and standard web MVC practices. In the
Services folder, the necessary files are present for the project requirements. Models have the
entities to save and load data and ViewModels for viewing and updating those models back to controllers.


A list of things I would have liked to add:
 * JavaScript to cycle between the questions, instead of having all questions shown at the same time
 * Finishing the grading system
 * Displaying the user's last score on the home page



I hope you would consider me for this opportunity. Working for Veridocs would be an incredible opportunity!
I look forward to speaking with you soon!
